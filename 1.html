    <p><strong><u>M</u>achine <u>L</u>earning (ML)</strong> is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of <strong><u>A</u>rtificial <u>I</u>ntelligence (AI)</strong>.</p><p style = "margin-top:20px;">Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.</p>
